The only thing crazier than a guy in snowbound Massachusetts boxing up the powdery white stuff
and offering it for sale online? People are actually buying it. For $89, self-styled entrepreneur
Kyle Waring will ship you 6 pounds of Boston-area snow in an insulated Styrofoam box – enough
for 10 to 15 snowballs, he says.
But not if you live in New England or surrounding states. “We will not ship snow to any states
in the northeast!” says Waring’s website, ShipSnowYo.com. “We’re in the business of expunging
snow!”
His website and social media accounts claim to have filled more than 133 orders for snow – more
than 30 on Tuesday alone, his busiest day yet. With more than 45 total inches, Boston has set a
record this winter for the snowiest month in its history. Most residents see the huge piles of snow
choking their yards and sidewalks as a nuisance, but Waring saw an opportunity.
According to Boston.com, it all started a few weeks ago, when Waring and his wife were shoveling deep snow from their yard in Manchester-by-the-Sea, a coastal suburb north of Boston.
He joked about shipping the stuff to friends and family in warmer states, and an idea was born.
His business slogan: “Our nightmare is your dream!” At first, ShipSnowYo sold snow packed
into empty 16.9-ounce water bottles for $19.99, but the snow usually melted before it reached its
destination...
